# The LeapFrog credits project
A project to give all artists and development studios/companies who worked at or with LeapFrog the credit they deserve

### Folder structure
This project will follow a very specific folder structure:
- "Ripped" is for credits extracted from games that already credit the artists who worked on them
- "Confirmed" is for credits obtained through asking former employees

There is no unconfirmed section and never will be because there's quite a few people in the LeapFrog community who obsessively make stuff up. They'd fill that section up with nonsense in a matter of weeks after finding it.

When enough games are well-documented and have good lists of names, a basic website will be made for this.

Also, we don't want this to be used to stalk people! Don't document personal info if you come across any. These will just be name lists associated with products. Nothing else.
